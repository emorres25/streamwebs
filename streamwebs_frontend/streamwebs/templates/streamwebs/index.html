        Every year thousands of students from around the state of Oregon collect
        a wide range of watershed data in the field, StreamWebs provides a way
        for students to follow up with the field experience back in the classroom.
        StreamWebs offers a suite of online applications for students to share and
        analyze their data and review the work of their peers. Students are able
        to upload their data and share their valuable contributions to watershed
        health with their community.
