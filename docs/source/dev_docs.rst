You can view and clone the StreamWebs Github repository `here <https://github.com/osuosl/streamwebs>`_. 

Testing
-------
The tests directory is located in streamwebs_frontend/streamwebs/ and contains three subdirectories: forms, models, and views, each of which contains files that test individual forms, models, and views. To run tests, you must be in the same directory in which manage.py is located, i.e. /streamwebs_frontend/.

There are a few different ways you can run tests in /streamwebs_frontend/. You can:

* Run all of them at once:

* Run just the tests of a specific directory (i.e. just the form tests, just the model tests, etc.):

* Run just the tests of a single file (i.e. just the tests for a specific form, just the tests for a specific model, etc.):

* Run a single specified test: 

* The Django testing framework is explained more in depth in its official documentation here.
