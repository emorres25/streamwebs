Using StreamWebs
================

StreamWebs allows you to log and browse data for various watershed sites. 
You don't need an account to view data, but in order to add a new site or 
record your own data on StreamWebs, you do need to register. 
Here's how to create an account and get started interacting with StreamWebs. 

Creating an Account
-------------------

Click the "Create Account" tab located near the head of the StreamWebs home 
page. You will be taken to a form which will ask you to provide the following:

* Your date of birth
* Your desired username
* Your desired password 
* Your email address
* Your first and last name
* The name of your school

You can indicate your school by typing all or part or its name into the 
appropriate field. A drop down menu will appear as you type and provide you 
with a list of schools that match what you have typed. You can then select 
your school from there. If you don't see your school listed in the drop down 
menu, first make sure that you are typing the official name of 
your school into the field rather than an abbreviation or nickname-- for 
example, you should type "Oregon State University" instead of "OSU". If your 
school still fails to appear, you can select the "Other" option at the bottom
and enter the name manually. 

When you're done with the form, hit the "Create New Account" button at the
bottom of the page to complete your registration.

Logging In
----------

After your StreamWebs account is set up, you can log in by clicking the 
"Log In" link at the top of the homepage and providing your password and 
either your username or your email address. If you've forgotten your password,
you can get a new one by clicking the "Request New Password" link. An email 
will be sent to you with instructions on how to reset your password.

-----

Now that you're logged in, you can not only view data for sites, but 
contribute to them as well.
